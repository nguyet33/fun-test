## Description:
The app I built is a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. The quiz will run in the browser and will be built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The quiz will be dynamic and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS that are powered by my JavaScript code. The app will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. This quiz app will help me become familiar with coding assessments that are typically part of an interview process for full-stack web developer positions. The app was built base on client's story and acceptance criterias.
